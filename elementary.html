          The Spark Studio is a place where our youngest learners come together to explore the world around them. Following an emergent curriculum driven by the child’s natural curiosity, the Spark Studio Program is experiential and intended to cultivate a love for learning. We are Montessori-based to increase confidence, emotional intelligence, and independence. Children use hands-on materials to build a strong foundation of core skills and have ample opportunities for exploration and free play.

          The Elementary Studio is a place where students come together to learn core skills, and develop life skills and character while having ample opportunities for collaboration, exploration, and free play. Children use hands-on materials as well as adaptive technology to build a strong foundation of core skills. Our Quests and Socratic discussions put a strong emphasis on creative and critical thinking. A primary goal in the Elementary Studio is to guide children in their development of social and problem solving skills. They learn how to set goals, work collaboratively, and love learning, while also helping and being helped by their friends in the Studio.
