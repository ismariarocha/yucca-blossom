          The Middle School Studio (Launching in 2019) is for students ages 11-14 who have already proven that they are able to work independently. These students will work on difficult real world problems and learn to write and think more deeply. Students continue collaborating, building their character and building friendships with their studio-mates who will challenge and support them through peer review of their work. This Studio ultimately brings students to a deeper understanding of their character, while they explore their natural talents and gifts to discover who they are and where they are headed.
