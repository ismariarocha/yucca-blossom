          The Eagles’ Nest Studio is designed to build the math, reading, self-regulatory, and social skills needed for success in the highly independent Acton Elementary Studio, or wherever their journey takes them next.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Our Eaglets help establish the rules in their Studio and meet for weekly Town Hall meetings to identify, discuss, and vote on issues that affect them.  They practice basic goal setting and complete challenges at their own pace to earn learning “badges” in math, reading, and citizenship.  The rest of the time, they learn through exploration in a series of hands-on project Quests and present what they’ve discovered at an exhibition at the end of each Session.

            I have seen so much development in our son, just in the last few months - not just academically, but in the way he responds to adults and even his younger brother.  He is also more prone to figure things out on his own rather than coming to me or his mom for everything. We love Acton and love what we are seeing in our son!
