          At Yucca Blossom, our children learn in a collaborative studio of multi-age learners. Our flexible approach challenges each student with their own differentiated learning plan and inspires them through real-world projects and experiences. Our Learner Driven Community puts children at the center of their learning, allowing them to create and maintain personal goals and relational covenants, as they Learn to Learn, Learn to Do, and Learn to Be.

        <p>Above all, we believe in delighting families with a <span class="bold">school experience you're thrilled about.</span></p>

        <p>One of the great experiences of life is the feeling of learning something challenging and worthwhile. Real growth is hard work – just like developing a muscle. It's often <span class="bold">even harder for parents than it is for children</span>. It's not easy, but few meaningful things are.</p>

        <p>For those up for the challenge, some of the outcomes we've observed are:</p>

          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <span class="list-title">Families feeling more unity and purpose</span> Families discover the joy of learning is a shared journey. As one parent described: "Acton Academy has transformed our family, inspiring each of us to find a calling and discover a Hero's Journey."
            </div>

          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <span class="list-title">Mastery of core academic skills</span> While only a small portion of the day is spent on Core Skills, and there is zero "teaching to the test," over the 9 years of Acton's history we've seen an average of 2.5 grade levels per year growth on the IOWA standardized test.

          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <span class="list-title">Self-management and leadership</span> The result parents likely appreciate most is seeing their children take ownership of their learning. Meeting an Acton student speaks for itself: they look you in the eye, ask powerful questions, are curious about the world around them, and have plans they're passionate about.
