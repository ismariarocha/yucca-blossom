          The Elementary Studio is designed to create flexible spaces for work, learning, and play. It is a tight-knit community of mixed-age children who support each other and collaborate daily. This environment fosters a culture of respect and much of the character development that occurs here.
        </p>
        <p>
          We replaced external motivators like high-stakes test scores and grades with an intrinsic growth mindset, so our children are motivated to work hard and have fun. Respect is the foundation for every other skill we learn at Yucca Blossom. We respect our time, our fellow learners, our space, and our materials. The children work together to create rules for the space. Some areas might be off limits for play, while others are more flexible. Ultimately, the learners come together to agree to those ground rules and promises—all based on a key promise to not distract themselves or each other during times of work.

            A community specially designed for our youngest members aged 18 months through 3 years old. The children here are cared for in a safe and nurturing environment that fosters trust in themselves and their world. They are able to develop confidence in their emerging abilities through freely chosen activities that support gross and fine motor skills, as well as language development. The children are given an active role in their daily tasks of self-care, helping them to gain independence.

            Our classroom for 3 to 6 year old children provides them with age-appropriate activities that foster the growth of functional independence, task-persistence and self-regulation. It contains materials designed to refine sensory perception and provide opportunities for language and mathematical skill development. There is also a wide range of activities available that encourage and support creative expression and exploration. We use respectful, clear communication of limits and natural consequences to support the child’s budding social development.
