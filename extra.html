        <h2 class="section-title">What makes Acton Academy so different?</h2>
        <ul class="styled-number-list small">
          <li>
            Acton Academy uses the latest technology in a self-paced learning environment designed to foster responsibility, goal-setting, and teamwork. Acton students are empowered to thrive in a world that needs independent, motivated thinkers and learners.
          </li>
          <li>
            We believe children learn best by doing. Whether it’s launching a startup business, creating a tidepool habitat, playing a musical instrument, painting a mosaic, or programming a robot, Acton students are building real-life skills in the classroom every day.
          </li>
          <li>
            We believe the learning experience is much richer when the teacher (“Guide”) offers insightful questions and facilitates hands on learning. Guides use the Socratic method, always responding to students’ questions with new questions. This exchange hones students’ critical thinking skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            Acton Academy is “student led.” This means young people take ownership of their education and peer relationships. Acton students learn to think independently, take responsibility and embrace challenge. They are being prepared to bring their own unique genius to the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            We believe in the power of apprenticeships. Beginning in middle school, our students obtain summer internships in a field they are passionate about. Acton students have interned with doctors, entrepreneur bakers, plumbers, attorneys and graphic designers. What will your child choose?
          </li>
          <li>
            We encourage our students to develop personal virtues such as honesty, hard work, responsibility, kindness and empathy. Armed with purpose and good character, we believe our students will launch into adulthood prepared to find their calling and change the world.

        <h2>Connect with Nature</h2>
        <p>
          We believe children should be outdoors and have access to nature in a deep, meaningful way. Forest School is a growing movement to bring the gift of nature to our children. During their Forest School hours, students will learn to make detailed observations of natural phenomenon in their nature journals and to design and conduct experiments to answer their scientific questions.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have secured a woodland lot for the children to design and learn in. Your children can undertake projects like: designing and building a treehouse, setting up and organic vegetable garden, keeping chickens for eggs and many more. Being located next to Yangmingshan National Park also means our students will have access to hundred of miles of hiking trails for further outdoor learning!
