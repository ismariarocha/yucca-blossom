        </h2>
        <p>
          This process is designed to make sure that we are the right school to serve the life-long learning needs for your child and your family.
        </p>
        <p class="mb3">We recognize that <span class="bold">we ask you to dedicate time and thought to the process</span>. Families who are thriving in our community often share that they truly enjoyed the process, and we hope you do too.</p>
        <p><strong>Admissions Policy</strong></p>
        <p class="mb3">Admissions Policy Acceptance of any applicant is based principally on the child’s readiness for the Montessori program as determined by guide-administrator interviews and the parents’ expectations of the school.  No child shall be denied admission on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender or handicap.</p>
        <p><strong>Admission Priorities</strong></p>
        <p>The following priorities are observed in determining admissions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Currently enrolled students (re-enrollment must be received before the deadline)</li>
          <li>Children of employees</li>
          <li>Balance and age and gender in the classroom</li>
          <li>Transfer students from other Montessori schools</li>
          <li>Date of application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If classes are full, prospective students will be put in a waiting pool.  Returning students will be given priority over new students in the waiting pool.</p>
